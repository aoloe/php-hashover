# Hashover

My personal fork of Hashover.

Just a bookmark because I don't want to forget about it...

HashOver is a PHP comment system intended as a replacement for services offering comments. HashOver adds a "comment section" to any website, by placing a few simple lines of JavaScript or PHP to the source code of any webpage.

HashOver is a self-hosted system and allows completely anonymous comments to be posted, the only required information is the comment itself.

HashOver is free and open source software under the GNU Affero General Public License
